# Puzzle 1: Hidden in Plain Sight
## Objective:
Users must use an image that is given to them on the puzzle webpage to decipher a key using the Vigenere Cipher. The goal of the puzzle is for the users to be more explorative with their solving ability. In short, they have to use what is already freely available to them to crack the puzzle.

## Tools available:
- The Image 
    - The crux of the whole puzzle is this image, because the filename and the key is hidden in the image itself
- Vigenere Cipher Table
    - without prior knowledge of the Vigenere Cipher, a few hints and guides will be given on the webpage to ensure that users can still solve the puzzle
- The Web Browser
    - The URL address bar plays a crucial role in this puzzle since they will use this to submit their final answer.
    - The point of not giving them a textbox to submit their answers in makes them more explorative and think more creatively about their puzzle-solving skills. They will learn to think outside of the box, or at least, outside of the webpage itself.
    - Having the URL address bar as the point of submission solidifies the "Hidden in Plain Sight" methodology of the puzzle, as the address bar is always there, they just have to learn to use it correctly to solve the puzzle.

## Mechanics:
- The users must download the image of the clue to move forward with the puzzle
- After finding both the clue and plaintext the user must learn to use the Vigenere Table to decode the real answer of the puzzle
- The final answer is a hidden webpage that shows the user that they have solved the puzzle and that the next puzzle for them to solve will unlock soon.
- There should be red herring pages such as using the plaintext itself as a submission page, which leads them to a page saying that they are close, but not really.

## Perks:
- Users can learn to be more resourceful in their URL address bar interactions after learning this puzzle
- Users can discover the possibility of hidden pages on websites, which might inspire them to learn more about cryptography and cybersecurity
- Users can discover the world of encryption and decryption which might make them more inclined to do puzzle solving

### This is meant to be a Red Herring Page as stated in the mechanics of this puzzle
![Image](https://github.com/Youth-Ortigas/conquest-documentation/blob/master/docs/images/Puzzle1ConceptRedHerring.png)
This page should show that the user was correct in their usage of the Vigenere Table and that the key they find in the image is correct

### This is meant to be the final answer page, but it also is a misdirect as for what key to use for Puzzle 2. 
![Image](https://github.com/Youth-Ortigas/conquest-documentation/blob/master/docs/images/Puzzle1ConceptFinalAnswer.png)
Armor, the Puzzle Key, or conquestclue can be possible keys to unlock Puzzle 2, however if users have found the Red Herring, we know that conquestclue by elimination is not the key.
