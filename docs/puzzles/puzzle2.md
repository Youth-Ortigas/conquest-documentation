# Puzzle 2: Words and Letters
## Objective:
The objective of this puzzle is to become more familiar with the overarching Scripture of the entire event. This puzzle will be a series of mini challenges with the 3rd and final stage being a decryption puzzle similar to Puzzle 1 but with a different method of dechipering. This time it will use a Caesar Cipher based on a previous stage of the puzzle.

## Tools available:
- Scripture
    - They will have been introduced already to the text based on the already existing text on the home page of the website, so familiarizing themselves with this text will help them greatly with the puzzle
- Caesar Cipher
    - Just some guidance on how a Caesar Cipher will ensure that the users will be able to solve the puzzle

## Mechanics:
### Stage 1: Wordle
- Users will play a wordle-styled game to unlock the next stage of the puzzle
    - There will be a mechanic in this stage to block the users from always trying to solve the puzzle in a single day
    - Initial concepts of this stage added an Elimination mechanic, which will inevitably be replaced by something better
- Based on the original game, this stage of the puzzle will use 5-letter words that will directly come from Scripture

### Stage 2: Fill in the Blanks
- After finishing the Wordle puzzle this stage is a buffer stage that leads to the 3rd and final stage of the puzzle
- This puzzle will explicitly show the Scripture of the event (best if ESV is used)
- There will be 5 words that need to be filled in to unlock the final stage of the puzzle
    - They will have varying length (letter count)
    - They will be specific (whether its a verb, or a noun, or an adjective)
- Textboxes will be placed for the user to input all the words and submitted
    - Once the user has filled in all 5 words, they can submit their answer and unlock the next puzzle
- It is highly anticipated that this will only take a short time, which is why the 3rd stage takes much longer

### Stage 3: Caesar Cipher
- To empower all the math lovers, users in their teams will have to solve a math problem involving the 5 words that were filled in during the previous stage
    - This math problem will be the key to solving the Caesar Cipher since the number they get will dictate the shifting alphabet of the Cipher
- Their plaintext to solve will also be explicitly given, and it will be a phrase (whitespaces will be disregarded, since this phrase is the key to the final puzzle)

## Perks
- Users will get to know the overarching text all the more
- Users will be given a bit of a break for hard puzzle solving (at least until Stage 3)
- Users will be introduced to a different encryption technique
- Users will be empowered to work as a team to solve the puzzle together

### Unlocking Screen

Both Puzzle 2 and [Puzzle 3](https://github.com/Youth-Ortigas/conquest-documentation/blob/master/docs/puzzles/puzzle3.md) will have this kind of screen which locks the puzzle behind the key that was taken from the previous puzzle. More discussion about locking will be discussed in another portion of the documentation

This stage of the puzzle will be revised in the final site, however the concept is the same. The word is also subject to change
